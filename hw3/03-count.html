						It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age
						of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of
						belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light,
						it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the
						winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing
						before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going
						direct the other wayâ€”in short, the period was so far like the
						present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on
						its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree
						of comparison only.
